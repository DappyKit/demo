# DappyKit Demo Project 🚀

## What is DappyKit? 🧩

Think of [DappyKit](https://github.com/DappyKit) like a big box of Lego blocks for making cool online apps where you can chat and play with your friends. But here's the best part: these apps don't belong to some big company – they belong to everyone who uses them! 

DappyKit helps you build these apps super easily. It's like having a superpower that lets you create online playgrounds, games, clubs, or even a place where people can help each other by sharing or lending stuff. 

The goal of DappyKit is to make it easy for lots more people (**we're talking billions!**) to use these new types of online spaces. To do that, we've made it simpler to join these spaces and to interact with the bits and pieces that make them work.

What's really cool is that these online spaces can't be taken away from you by a big company because they're decentralized, which means they belong to all of us. Isn't that awesome? 🌐💡

## What We've Built 🏗️

To show you how DappyKit can be used to build social apps, we've put together a fun little project. We've created a [Twitter-like](https://github.com/DappyKit/demo-twi) app with a twist. You can log in using Metamask if you're already a crypto whizz. But for those new to the crypto scene, we've also incorporated the [Meme Wallet](https://github.com/DappyKit/meme-wallet), which makes joining the Web3 space a piece of cake!

But wait, there's more! We've baked social connections right into the heart of our app. We've created and thoroughly tested our [`SocialConnections`](https://github.com/DappyKit/demo-contracts) smart contract, which we've launched into the [Linea Goerli network](https://explorer.goerli.linea.build/address/0xB174817cc2619a2829e59EE12B0666647C29c855). To sweeten the deal, we've automatically connected you with 10 test users. It's all with your approval, of course. The cherry on top? You can interact with it without spending a gas!

You might be thinking, "But where does my content live?" Well, we've got you covered there, too. We've integrated a [Worldwide File System](https://github.com/FairJournal/file-system) that lets you store your public content and display it in all sorts of ways. One way to display short posts is through a Twitter-like UI, which we've implemented.

So, that's our demo. It's a small taste of what you can do with DappyKit, and we think it's a pretty tasty morsel at that! 🚀🌐

## Consensys Tech Stack Using 🧰

We're using a robust tech stack to bring the decentralized social network to life:

- **Linea Goerli**: Our smart contracts are deployed on the Linea Goerli testnet. This provides a secure and scalable environment for dApps.
- **Metamask SDK**: We're using the Metamask SDK to handle user authentication and wallet management. It allows our users to seamlessly interact with our dApp through their Metamask wallets.
- **Infura Linea Goerli Endpoint**: Infura's Linea Goerli endpoint provides us with a reliable and fast connection to the Linea Goerli network. This is crucial for interacting with our smart contracts and processing transactions.
- **Truffle**: Truffle is our tool of choice for developing, testing, and deploying our smart contracts. Its suite of tools and features makes smart contract development a breeze.
